# Ray Tracing in One Weekend
Following 'Ray Tracing in One Weekend' by Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black, Steve Hollasch in Rust. I kept the code mostly in line with what is presented in the book, with the two exceptions being abstracting some logic for cameras and adding multithreading for writing pixels. Below is the final render outlined in the book as well as a video I created demonstrating the blur effect from changing the size of the camera aperture.
